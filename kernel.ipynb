        "#### LASSO Regression \n",
        "In statistics and machine learning, lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)  is a **regression analysis** method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.  Lasso was originally formulated for least squares models and this simple case reveals a substantial amount about the behavior of the estimator, including its relationship to ridge regression and best subset selection and the connections between lasso coefficient estimates and so-called soft thresholding. It also reveals that (like standard linear regression) the coefficient estimates need not be unique if covariates are collinear.\n",
